                    anti-Chinese perfromances and was often used to show how different they were from Americans.

                    were not allowed to become naturalized citizens.

                    exclusion. This was the country's first siginificant restricitive immigration law and the first to
                    restrict based on race and class. This shaped twentieth-century United States race-based immigration
                    policies.

                    Supreme Court affirmed the right of the federal government to exclude Chinese, and by doing
                    so, it also established the legal and constitutional foundation for federal immigration restriction
                    and exclusion based on national sovereignty.
